# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This course project aims to demonstrate how to collect, work with, and clean a data set using a [Human Activity Recognition data from University of California, Irvine](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

Please refer to the [CodeBook.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wxn0000/getdata-012-project/master/CodeBook.Rmd) file in this repo for detailed descriptions on all the steps taken to clean up the data set.

[run_analysis.R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wxn0000/getdata-012-project/master/run_analysis.R) file contains all the code required to get and clean the data set and generate two data frames in your R environment: _tidyData_ is the tidied data set, and _output_ is the required output data. Finally, _output.txt_ is generated for submission to Coursera.

Thanks for your the attention!
