This course project aims to demonstrate how to collect, work with, and clean a data set using a [Human Activity Recognition data from University of California, Irvine](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

Please refer to the [CodeBook.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wxn0000/getdata-012-project/master/CodeBook.Rmd) file in this repo for detailed descriptions on all the steps taken to clean up the data set.
